This project showcases an Interactive Navigation Menu designed to enhance user experience by providing dynamic visual feedback. The menu has been developed to remain fixed at the top of the page, ensuring it is always visible as users navigate through different sections of the website. The key feature of this menu is its ability to change color or style based on user interaction, such as scrolling or hovering over specific menu items.
<b>TECHNOLOGY USED </b> 
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring the content and implementing responsive styling.<br/>
JAVASCRIPT: For adding interactivity, such as detecting scroll events and applying dynamic style changes.
